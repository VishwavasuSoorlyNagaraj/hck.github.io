               <br/>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey kicked off around 2009-2010 with a bunch of Indians who had made their way to Norway, eager to enjoy themselves and make the most of those long Norwegian summer days. They began by playing with a soft tennis ball on the lush green lawns of a neighborhood where one of the members lived, right there in Helsfyr. And thus, Helsfyr Cricket Klubb (HCK) was born. The fun, the camaraderie, and, of course, the cricket, drew in friends and families alike, swelling our ranks as time passed.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Come summer of 2012, things took a serious turn when a talented bunch of cricketers, many of whom were recent arrivals to Norway, joined the group. We dubbed ourselves the "Oslo Geniuses," and the cricket fever hit new heights. We were unstoppable, playing match after match, soaking in the glory of the game.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               In 2013, we ventured into tennis ball matches with established teams across Norway, and boy, did we make waves! Our team became a force to be reckoned with, dominating the scene. With more players flocking to join us, we shifted our base from Helsfyr to Ekeberg and organized our own tournament, which, you guessed it, we won! Buoyed by our success, we decided it was time to take on the big leagues and registered ourselves with the Norwegian Cricket Federation (NCF) as Helsfyr Cricket Klubb.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Despite a setback in 2014 due to a lack of playing grounds, we soldiered on, practicing relentlessly, sharing nets with top division clubs, and playing friendly matches. We even dabbled in indoor and outdoor tournaments, refusing to let obstacles dampen our spirits.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Finally, in 2015, our moment arrived. We debuted in the Introliga, a new division of the NCF, and while the season had its ups and downs, we held our ground, proving ourselves worthy competitors. The following year, we entered the 5th Division and continued to showcase our skills, winning matches and earning our spot among the top teams.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Fast forward to 2024, and here we are, proudly playing T20 in Division 4, a testament to our perseverance and passion for the game. The journey may have had its challenges, but every victory, every setback, has only fueled our determination to keep swinging for the fences.
               <br/>
